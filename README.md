# My Entry for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer Contest
This is my entry for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer Contest. It uses the LeNet architecture implemented using PyTorch. This helped me achieve in the top 10% in terms of model accuracy out of all entries in the competition.

My analysis and implementation is in the `DigitRecognizer.ipynb` file.
