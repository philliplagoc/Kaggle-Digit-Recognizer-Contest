    "This is my entry for Kaggle's [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). \n",
    "In this challenge, I will use computer vision techniques, more specifically image classification, to build a model to recognize hand-written digits from the famous MNIST dataset. \n",
    "To help me achieve this, I will use [Dr. Ghouzam's notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6) as well as [DataAI's notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/recurrent-neural-network-with-pytorch/data#INTRODUCTION) to build a model in PyTorch to compete in this competition."
